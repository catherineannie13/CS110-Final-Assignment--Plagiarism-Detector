# CS110-Final-Assignment--Plagiarism-Detector

* The plagiarism detector takes 2 strings (X and Y) and compares substrings of length k (parameter) to find matches.
* It first stores substrings of X in a hash table using rolling hashing to compute hash values.
* Collisions are managed using double hashing.
* Substrings of Y are then searched for in the hash table, again using rolling hashing to compute hash values, and double hashing to manage collisions.
* The overall program returns the indexes in the strings X and Y at which we would find matching substrings of length k.
